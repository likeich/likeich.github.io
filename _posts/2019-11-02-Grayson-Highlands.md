title: Grayson Highlands and Mt. Rogers Backpacking Trip
date: 2019-11-02
---

I just took an overnight backpacking trip to Grayson Highlands with a group of friends. The main goal of the trip was to visit Mount Rogers, the highest peak in Virginia, and to see its beautiful ecosystem. For the trip, I decided to challenge myself by bringing only a small backpack, my 26L GoRuck GR1, to test how far I could push the pack and my own comfort levels. Although it was a 1-night trip, the temperatures dropped to 20°F with strong winds on the mountain. I had limited space, so I had to figure out what was essential.

## The Gear

### First Version

To prepare, I packed my backpack the week before the trip, excluding food and water.

**Hydration System**

**Outside of My Backpack**

- **Sleeping Bag**: Standard Army patrol sleeping bag in a random compression sack.
- **Sleeping Pad**: An old ThermaRest pad, planning to replace soon.
- **Other**: Sunglasses case attached to the pack, ITW Web Dominator for bladder hose, sternum strap add-on.

**Main Compartment**

- Hammock system (hammock, straps, tarp, ground stakes).
- Water bottle with waterproof bag cover.
- Down throw blanket (eventually ditched), compression cube, and small molle pocket.

**Pockets**

- **Top Pocket**: Electronics and flashlights (headlamp, earbuds, Kindle Paperwhite, extra phone battery).
- **Mesh Pocket**: Extra clothes and hand warmers.
- **Outside Pocket**: Beanie, gloves, buff.

### What Changed

I replaced the down throw blanket with a fleece sleeping bag liner but had to ditch both due to space issues. I added an Army-issue bivy cover for my sleeping bag and packed 2 trash bags as emergency rain covers. The compression cube was used for dirty clothes.

## The Trip

### Daytime

Both hikes were easy, but I struggled to regulate my temperature. Either I wore my raincoat and sweated, or I braved the wind without it. I opted for the latter to avoid freezing at night. The views were beautiful, and wild ponies added a fun touch. The open fields and rock outcroppings were a refreshing change from the Shenandoah National Park.

### The Long Night

The cold night was a challenge, compounded by the time change, which meant an extra hour in the hammock. My strategy to stay warm:

1. Place the hammock close to the ground and stake the tarp directly to reduce airflow.
2. Put my sleeping pad inside the bivy cover to form a cocoon and prevent it from moving.
3. Sleep in my sleeping bag inside the bivy cover with all layers on and place body warmers all over.
4. Boil water to put in a bottle for warmth.

The plan worked! I stayed warm all night, waking only a few times, never from the cold. At dawn, a gust of wind pulled my tarp off, and I spent a few minutes securing it again.

## What To Change for the Next Trip

### Gear I Need to Replace/Buy

**Replace**

- **Sleeping Bag**: Looking for an ultralight bag rated for at least 20°F.

- Packable down jacket

- Winter Buff
- Insulated water bottle
